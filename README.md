# BrowserTabs
Simulating the functionality of the tabs in a browser.
Using a doubly linked list as a base , it is wrapped in another structure
called browser tabs which literally simulates the work of tabs.
Tabs can be inserted, removed, loaded , sorted.
Used this project as an excercise for structures and sorting algorithms.
